# Issue: Blog Page Missing Navbar and Footer

## Problem Description

The blog page (`blog.html`) was not displaying the navigation bar and footer properly, making it inconsistent with other pages on the site.

### Issues Identified
- **Missing Navbar**: The header navigation was not visible on the blog page
- **Missing Footer**: The footer section was not displaying
- **Inconsistent Layout**: Blog page looked different from other pages like Explore Cars

## Expected Behavior

- Blog page should have a visible navigation bar at the top
- Footer should be displayed at the bottom
- Layout should be consistent with other pages in the site
- All navigation links should work properly

## Root Cause

The blog page had CSS overrides or missing styles that were hiding the navbar and footer elements, making them invisible to users.

## Impact

- **User Experience**: Users couldn't navigate away from the blog page easily
- **Design Consistency**: Blog page looked incomplete compared to other pages
- **Navigation**: Users were essentially trapped on the blog page without visible navigation

## Files Affected

- `blog.html` - Main blog page file

## Solution Applied

- Added explicit CSS visibility overrides for navbar and footer
- Ensured proper CSS includes for base site styles
- Restored original blog content while fixing visibility issues

## Priority

**Medium** - Affects user navigation and site consistency
