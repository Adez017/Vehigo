    title: "What cars are most vulnerable",
    author: "Benialla Dsouza",

    content: "When it comes to car security, not all vehicles face the same risks. Some cars are more vulnerable to theft or damage due to their popularity, design, or the technology they use.\n\nPopular models, especially compact sedans and mid-size SUVs, are often targeted simply because their spare parts are in high demand. Thieves may dismantle these vehicles quickly and sell the components separately, making it harder for authorities to trace the crime. Older cars without modern immobilizers, GPS tracking, or factory-installed alarms are also more susceptible to theft because they can be hotwired in a matter of minutes.\n\nLocation also plays a major role in vehicle vulnerability. Cars parked regularly in low-lit, unmonitored, or isolated areas can be at higher risk, regardless of their make or model. Urban areas with dense populations and higher crime rates statistically see more incidents of car theft and vandalism. On the other hand, rural regions may experience fewer thefts, but vehicles there can still be targeted if they are left unattended for extended periods without adequate security measures.\n\nTechnological advancements in vehicles have improved convenience for drivers, but they have also introduced new security challenges. For example, keyless entry and ignition systems can be vulnerable to relay attacks, where criminals use signal amplification devices to unlock and start a car without the physical key. Similarly, cars connected to mobile apps may face cybersecurity risks if the apps or the car’s onboard system are not adequately protected against hacking attempts.\n\nAt Vehigo, protecting our fleet — and your journey — is a top priority. Every car in our rental lineup is equipped with advanced GPS tracking systems that allow us to monitor vehicle locations in real time. This not only helps us recover vehicles quickly in the unlikely event of theft but also assists in ensuring safe driving practices. Our cars feature tamper-proof locking systems and, in many cases, keyless ignition technology with encrypted codes that make it significantly harder for thieves to bypass security.\n\nWe go beyond standard manufacturer security by conducting regular in-house security audits and upgrades. Our technical team tests each vehicle’s locks, alarms, immobilizers, and tracking systems to ensure they are functioning at peak performance. If a vulnerability is discovered, we act immediately to patch it — whether that means updating the firmware of electronic systems, replacing a physical component, or adding an additional security device.\n\nVehigo also takes parking security seriously. When our cars are not in use, they are kept in secure, monitored facilities with controlled access. Surveillance cameras operate 24/7, and motion-activated lighting helps deter potential intruders. We also partner with local law enforcement and security agencies to stay informed about emerging threats and theft patterns, allowing us to adapt our protection strategies accordingly.\n\nFor our customers, we offer guidance on safe parking practices. We advise avoiding secluded or dimly lit areas whenever possible, locking the car even during short stops, and keeping valuables out of sight to reduce temptation for opportunistic theft. Our team also educates renters about recognizing suspicious activity and encourages them to report concerns immediately.\n\nIn addition, Vehigo offers optional coverage plans for extra peace of mind. These plans can include roadside assistance, damage protection, and theft coverage, ensuring that even in the rare case of an incident, our customers are not left to deal with the stress and financial burden alone.\n\nWe recognize that every journey is unique, and so are the security needs that come with it. A customer driving through a busy metropolitan city may need different advice than one traveling to remote tourist destinations. That’s why we customize our safety tips and recommendations based on your itinerary, driving habits, and the type of vehicle you rent.\n\nOur security approach is not static — it evolves with the industry. As new threats emerge, whether physical or digital, Vehigo is committed to adopting cutting-edge solutions. From anti-cloning key technology to AI-based tracking systems capable of predictive route monitoring, we continually invest in innovations that keep our fleet, and you, safe.\n\nVehigo also trains its staff extensively in recognizing and responding to potential security issues. This training covers everything from handling attempted break-ins to addressing cybersecurity alerts. Our goal is to ensure that every member of our team, from customer service agents to fleet managers, plays an active role in keeping our cars secure.\n\nIn short, while some cars may be statistically more vulnerable due to their make, model, or technological features, Vehigo ensures that every vehicle you rent is protected to the highest standards. Our layered security strategy combines advanced technology, physical deterrents, expert monitoring, and customer awareness to create a strong shield against potential threats.\n\nWhen you choose Vehigo, you are not just renting a car — you are gaining the confidence to travel without the constant worry of security risks. We believe that your focus should be on the journey ahead, the memories you will create, and the destinations you will explore — not on whether your vehicle is safe. With Vehigo, every ride begins with safety, continues with peace of mind, and ends with your complete satisfaction."

    content: "When it comes to car rentals, age plays a bigger role than most people think.

Some premium vehicles may have higher age limits.\n4. **Security Deposit** — A refundable deposit is taken at the time of rental to cover any potential damages or violations.\n5. **Confirmed Booking** — Whether booked online or offline, ensure your booking details are correct, including pickup and drop-off locations.\n\nBy keeping these requirements ready, you can speed up the rental process and hit the road without delay.
