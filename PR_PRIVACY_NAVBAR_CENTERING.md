# Pull Request: Add Navbar and Dark Mode to Privacy Policy Page

## 📝 Description
This PR adds a full, functional navbar to `privacypolicy.html` and implements comprehensive dark mode support to match the rest of the site.

## 🐛 Problems Addressed
- Missing or non-functional navbar on the privacy policy page
- No dark mode styling applied to the page
- Inconsistent layout and navigation vs. `index.html`

## ✅ Solution Overview
- Added standardized Bootstrap navbar (logo, links, theme toggle, login/logout)
- Implemented dark mode using CSS variables with `localStorage` persistence for the theme
- Ensured correct link targets, including `featured-car.html` for Explore cars
- Matched navbar layout and behaviors with the homepage

## 🔧 Changes Made
- **File**: `privacypolicy.html`
- **HTML**: Injected navbar markup identical to homepage, adjusted links
- **CSS**:
  - Introduced or extended CSS variables for dark/light themes
  - Added dark-mode aware styles for navbar, backgrounds, text, cards, and buttons
  - Ensured hamburger icon visibility in dark mode
- **JS**: Theme toggle logic with `localStorage` based persistence

## 🎯 Result
- ✅ Navbar visible and responsive on all breakpoints
- ✅ Theme toggle switches page between dark/light and persists
- ✅ All nav links functional with correct relative paths
- ✅ Visual parity with `index.html`
